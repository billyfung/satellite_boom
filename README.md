Simulation of Gravity Gradient Stabilization of a Satellite 

This is a project to simulate low Earth orbit satellites using gravity gradient stabilization. Done in Processing (java) for the purpose of displaying something nice without too much work. Design consisted of gravity boom satellite subjected to physics simulation. We observed the rotation angles of the satellite and the Earth to determine how long it takes to stabilize in orbit. Test cases were done with different levels of eccentricity and we observed stabilization.
